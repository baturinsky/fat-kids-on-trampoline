# fat-kids-on-trampoline
A game for js13kgames jam

Neighborhood kids caught a wind of you getting a giant trampoline and want to play.
Though, they have no safety training, so you have no choice but politely send them BACK.
They may object, but a strong enough kick makes them lose control temporarily, letting you usher them out.
You get a point for each de-trampolined kid.
If you fall off, you lose 5 points.

Game ends when there are 15 kids present (including you).

Move with WASD, arrow keys, NUMPAD or IJKL for player 1 to 4 respectively. X,M and comma can be used for down direction too.
P to pause. ESC to reset.

Have fun, and don't act recklessly or agressively on trampoline in real life!
